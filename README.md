### Hi there 👋

I'm a life scientist who enjoys statistics, playing around with data and learning programming.

I studied Biological Sciences at Imperial College London, where I first learnt R and took an interest in bioinformatics and computational biology, which led me to doing a couple of projects with Dr Martin Brazeau on phylogenetic methods, morphometrics and evolutionary modelling.

Since then, I have been working on my own healthtech business (Sukoon) and learnt software engineering, with HyperionDev, while continuing to learn R.
